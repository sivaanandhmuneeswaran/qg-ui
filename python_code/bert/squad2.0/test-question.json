[{"index":1,"original_sentence":"existing image captioning models do not generalize well to out-of-domain images containing novel scenes or objects . this limitation severely hinders the use of these models in real world applications dealing with images in the wild . we address this problem using a flexible approach that enables existing deep captioning architectures to take advantage of image taggers at test time , without re-training . our method uses constrained beam search to force the inclusion of selected tag words in the output , and fixed , pretrained word embeddings to facilitate vocabulary expansion to previously unseen tag words . using this approach we achieve state of the art results for out-of-domain captioning on mscoco -LRB- and improved results for in-domain captioning -RRB- . perhaps surprisingly , our results significantly outperform approaches that incorporate the same tag predictions into the learning algorithm . we also show that we can significantly improve the quality of generated imagenet captions by leveraging ground-truth labels .
